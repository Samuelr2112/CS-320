How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure my code is functional and secure, I implement a thorough testing process that includes unit tests, boundary testing, and exception handling. These tests help verify that the software behaves as expected in typical and edge cases, minimizing the risk of errors. Security is handled by validating inputs, properly managing errors, and ensuring that critical functions, such as data validation and user authentication, are correctly implemented and thoroughly tested.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs begins with gathering clear and detailed requirements, ensuring I understand the users' goals. Once I have these requirements, I translate them into technical specifications and design solutions that meet these expectations. Throughout development, I revisit the user needs to confirm that the software remains aligned with the intended functionality, continuously refining the program based on feedback and tests.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by breaking down the system into modular components, each with a specific responsibility. This allows for easier testing, maintainability, and scalability. I focus on designing software that is not only functional but also adaptable, using object-oriented principles to ensure the code is organized and can evolve with future requirements. Additionally, I keep user requirements at the core of the design to create a system that is both intuitive and efficient.
