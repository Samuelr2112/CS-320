# Task, Contact, and Appointment Management System
# Project Overview
This project is a Task, Contact, and Appointment Management System developed in Java. It offers essential functionalities to manage tasks, contacts, and appointments by allowing users to add, delete, and update records. The system is designed with a modular approach, dividing it into core services, such as TaskService, ContactService, and AppointmentService, to handle the business logic. Additionally, unit tests are included to ensure the proper functioning of these services, making the project a great example of combining service management with rigorous testing practices.

# Features
The project focuses on two key areas. First, the task, contact, and appointment services enable seamless management of records by providing functionality to add, update, and delete entries. Second, unit tests for each of these services ensure that the system behaves as expected under different scenarios. The project prioritizes both functionality and correctness, ensuring the services work reliably and securely.

# Files
The project consists of two main directories. The main/ directory contains the core implementation for managing tasks, contacts, and appointments. The test/ directory includes unit tests that validate the functionality of each service. Together, these files represent a well-rounded system with a focus on object-oriented programming and software testing.
